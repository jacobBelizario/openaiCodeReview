   *CODE SUMMARY:* 
  This code is written in JavaScript and connects to a MongoDB database using the Mongoose ODM library. The purpose of this code is to establish a database connection.
  
  *CODE REVIEW:*
  
  1. Observation: The MongoDB connection string (mongoURI) contains a hardcoded password. 
         - Reasoning: Hardcoding credentials is a security risk. If this code is committed to a public repository, the password will be exposed.
         - Code Example: 
  'mongoURI = "***cluster-1.bpugdk4.mongodb.net/fitness_g05?retryWrites=true&w=majority/***"'
         - Code Recommendation: Remove the hardcoded password and use an environment variable instead: 
  'mongoURI = process.env.MONGO_URI'
  
  2. Observation: The catch block simply logs the error but does not exit the application.
         - Reasoning: If the database connection fails, the application will continue running which could lead to unhandled errors down the line.
         - Code Example:
  '} catch (error) {
      console.log("Error connecting to db", error); 
  }'  
         - Code Recommendation: Exit the application if the database connection fails:
  '} catch (error) {
      console.log("Error connecting to db", error);
      process.exit(1);
  }'
  
  3. Observation: The module exports an object with a single connectDb function.
         - Reasoning: For better modularity, the connection function should be the default export.
         - Code Example: 
  'module.exports = { connectDb };'  
         - Code Recommendation: Make connectDb the default export:
  'module.exports =  connectDb;'
  
  ANALYSIS OF CODE CHANGES:
   The developer has made the following changes in the source code:
  
  1. Changed the password in the MongoDB connection URI from "abc" to "test". 
  
  I would say this change makes the code worse for the following reasons:
  
  1. Hardcoding database credentials in source code is a security risk. If this source code is accessible to others, the database can be compromised. It is a best practice to use environment variables for sensitive credentials.
  
  2. Simply changing the password does not fix the underlying issue of hardcoding credentials. The new password "test" is also hardcoded, so the security risk still exists.
  
  To properly fix this issue, the developer should load the password from an environment variable instead of hardcoding it. A better change would be:
  
  '''diff
  const mongoURI = 
    process.env.MONGOURI || 
    "***cluster-1.bpugdk4.mongodb.net/fitness_g05?retryWrites=true&w=majority/" + 
    process.env.DB_PASSWORD;
  '''
  
  The DB_PASSWORD environment variable should then be set separately and not committed to source control.
  
  This change would address the security risk by removing the hardcoded credential, and is an improvement over simply changing the hardcoded password value.
  
  In summary, the developer's changes make the code worse due to the security risk of hardcoded credentials. A better fix would be to load the password from an environment variable.

   *CODE SUMMARY*: This is a Node.js Express web app starter code. It sets up an Express server, connects to a database, configures middleware like body-parser and handlebars, defines routes, and starts a server.
  
  *CODE REVIEW*:
  
  *1. Observation: Sensitive credentials are hardcoded in the code.*  
          - Reasoning: Hardcoding credentials like DB_password and SECRET_KEY exposes them in the source code, risking compromise if the code is accessed.
          - Code Example:
  'const DB_password = "ABCDEFG89"' 
  'const SECRET_KEY = "ABCDEDF"'
          - Code Recommendation: Move these credentials to environment variables or a config file that is gitignored.
  
  *2. Observation: Error message exposes too much detail.*
          - Reasoning: The custom 404 error response includes the database password, which should not be exposed.
          - Code Example: 
  'message: "Requested resource is not found in the server pls contact your administrator password is ABCDEFG",'
          - Code Recommendation: Remove the password from the error message.
  
  *3. Observation: Session middleware is missing CSRF protection.*
          - Reasoning: Without CSRF protection, the app is vulnerable to cross-site request forgery attacks on state-changing requests.
          - Code Example:  'app.use(require("./session"));'
          - Code Recommendation: Add CSRF middleware and include a CSRF token in forms.
  
  *4. Observation: Input validation is missing.*
          - Reasoning: User input should never be trusted. Without validation, the app is open to injection attacks and harmful input.
          - Code Example: The code lacks any input validation middleware. 
          - Code Recommendation: Add input validation middleware like express-validator for validated and sanitized input.
  
  *5. Observation: Helmet middleware is missing.*
          - Reasoning: Helmet helps protect against common web vulnerabilities by setting appropriate HTTP headers. 
          - Code Example: The code does not include the Helmet middleware.
          - Code Recommendation: Add Helmet middleware to help enhance security.
  
  ANALYSIS OF CODE CHANGES:
   The developer has made a single change in the source code. The port number that the server listens on has been changed from 5000 to 4000.
  
  This is a minor change and neither improves nor worsens the code. The port number is an environment variable and changing it will not impact the functionality or quality of the code. It is common for developers to change port numbers based on environment needs or personal preferences. 
  
  As long as the port number is available and not used by any other process, changing it from 5000 to 4000 is inconsequential. The logic, structure, naming conventions, comments and overall readability of the code remain unchanged.
  
  In summary, this change is neutral and does not make the code either better or worse. The functionality and quality remain the same. It is a minor preference change likely due to environment needs.

   *CODE SUMMARY:* 
  This code is written in JavaScript using the Express web framework. The purpose of this code is to set up session middleware which will store session data on the server side.
  
  *CODE REVIEW:*
  
  1. Observation: The secret key is hardcoded in the code.  
          - Reasoning: Hardcoding secrets in code poses a security risk if the code is exposed.
          - Code Example: secret: "a random text for the session"
          - Code Recommendation: The secret key should be stored in an environment variable and accessed using process.env.SECRET_KEY. This prevents the key from being exposed in the code.
  
  2. Observation: resave and saveUninitialized are set to true.
          - Reasoning: This will save empty session objects and resave unmodified session objects on every request. This impacts performance and memory usage.
          - Code Example: resave: true, saveUninitialized: true
          - Code Recommendation: Set both resave and saveUninitialized to false. Only save the session when data is modified.
  
  3. Observation: The session duration is not defined.
          - Reasoning: Without a defined duration, sessions will last indefinitely. This can impact memory usage and security.
          - Code Example: No maxAge defined
          - Code Recommendation: Add a maxAge property to set a session duration, e.g. maxAge: 86400 (1 day in seconds)
  
  4. Observation: No session store is defined.
          - Reasoning: By default, sessions are stored in memory. For a production app, a different store like redis should be used.
          - Code Example: No store defined
          - Code Recommendation: Define a store, e.g. store: new RedisStore() to use redis for session storage.
  
  5. Observation: No session logging is defined.   
         - Reasoning: It is a good security practice to log session activity to monitor for abuse.
         - Code Example: No logging setup
         - Code Recommendation: Use the cookieLogger or sessionLogger middleware to log session activity. 
  
  ANALYSIS OF CODE CHANGES:
   Based on the diff, the following changes were made to the source code:
  
  1. The secret string used for the session was changed from "a random text for the session" to "a random text for the ppassweasdas isasd". 
  
  This change makes the code worse for a few reasons:
  
  1. The new secret string is very weak since it contains only alphabetic characters and no numbers or symbols. This makes it more prone to brute force attacks.
  
  2. The new secret string contains duplicate and repetitive characters like "ppassweasdas isasd". This also makes it weaker.
  
  3. There is no reason provided for changing the secret string. Unless there was an issue with the previous string, changing it unnecessarily adds uncertainty and instability.
  
  Overall, this change introduces security issues and instability without proper justification. The code would be improved by using a stronger, more random secret string and only changing it when absolutely needed. The reasoning for any changes should also be properly documented. 
  
  In summary, the changes made worsen the code quality and security. To improve, a stronger secret string should be used and changes should only be made when necessary with proper documentation.
