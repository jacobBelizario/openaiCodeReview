   Here is my code review:
  
  *CODE SUMMARY:* 
  This code connects to a MongoDB database using the Mongoose ODM (Object Document Mapper) library in Node.js.
  
  *CODE REVIEW:*
  
  1. Observation: The mongoURI contains a hardcoded password.  
         - Reasoning: Hardcoding credentials is a security risk if the code is exposed.
         - Code Example: '"***cluster-1.bpugdk4.mongodb.net/fitness_g05?retryWrites=true&w=majority/***"'
         - Code Recommendation: Use environment variables to store the password and other sensitive credentials.
  
  2. Observation: The catch block simply logs the error. 
         - Reasoning: If the database connection fails, it can break the application. The error should be handled appropriately.
         - Code Example: 
  '''js
  catch (error) {
      console.log("Error connecting to db", error); 
  }
  '''
         - Code Recommendation: Catch the error and handle it properly - either retry connecting or exit the application gracefully.
  
  3. Observation: No timeout is set for the database connection.
         - Reasoning: If the database is unreachable for some reason, the connection attempt can hang indefinitely.
         - Code Example: 'await mongoose.connect(mongoURI);'
         - Code Recommendation: Set a timeout for the connection attempt using setTimeout. For example: 
  '''js 
  let dbConnectTimeout = setTimeout(() => {
     console.log('DB connection timed out!') 
  }, 10000)  // 10 seconds
  
  await mongoose.connect(mongoURI);
  
  clearTimeout(dbConnectTimeout)  // Clear timeout if connection is successful
  '''
  
  4. Observation: No validation is done on the mongoURI.
         - Reasoning: If an invalid URI is provided, the connection will fail with a cryptic error.
         - Code Example: 'await mongoose.connect(mongoURI);'  
         - Code Recommendation: Validate the URI format before attempting to connect. For example:
  '''js
  let isValid = mongoose.isValidURI(mongoURI);
  if (!isValid) {
    console.log('Invalid MongoDB URI!');
    process.exit(1); 
  }
  await mongoose.connect(mongoURI);
  '''
  
  ANALYSIS OF CODE CHANGES:
   The developer has made a small change in the source code by updating the password in the MongoDB URI from "abc" to "test".
  
  This change improves the security of the code. Exposing database credentials like password in source code is a bad practice and poses security risk. By updating the hardcoded password, the developer has addressed this issue and improved the security.
  
  However, a better approach would have been to not have the password hardcoded in the source code at all. The developer could have used environment variables to manage the MongoDB credentials. That would have ensured that no sensitive credentials are exposed in the source code.
  
  So in summary, while the change of updating the password improves security over having it hardcoded, a environment variable approach would have been a better solution. The current change is a small improvement but not the best approach for managing database credentials.

   *CODE SUMMARY:*
  This code is a Node.js Express web application boilerplate. It sets up an Express server with various middleware (like body-parser, express-handlebars, etc.), connects to a database, defines some routes, and renders views.
  
  *CODE REVIEW:*
  
  *1. Observation: The DB_password and SECRET_KEY constants are hardcoded in the code.*
          - Reasoning: Hardcoding sensitive credentials like this exposes them in plain text and poses a security risk.
          - Code Example: 
  '''js
  const DB_password = "ABCDEFG89"  
  const SECRET_KEY = "ABCDEDF"
  '''
          - Code Recommendation: Move these sensitive values to environment variables or a .env file and load them using the dotenv package.
  
  *2. Observation: The error handler exposes too much detail in the error response.*
          - Reasoning: The error response includes the error message "Requested resource is not found in the server pls contact your administrator password is ABCDEFG". This exposes too much detail and could pose a security risk.
          - Code Example:
  '''js 
  app.use((req, res) => {
    res.render("error", {
      layout: "primary",
      data: error404,
      cssFile: "error.css",
    });
  });
  '''
          - Code Recommendation: Remove the error message from the error404 object so the response only contains the status code and generic heading.
  
  *3. Observation: The routes are not logically organized.* 
          - Reasoning: The routes are defined in a single app.use() block. As the application grows, this will become difficult to maintain.
          - Code Example: 
  '''js
  // Routes Endpoints  
  app.use("/users", require("./routes/users"));
  app.use("/classes", require("./routes/classes")); 
  // ...
  '''
          - Code Recommendation: Organize the routes into groups based on resource or feature, and define each group in its own app.use() block. For example:
  
  '''js
  // User routes
  app.use("/users", require("./routes/users"));
  
  // Class routes 
  app.use("/classes", require("./routes/classes"));  
  
  // Cart routes
  app.use("/cart", require("./routes/cart"));
  '''
  
  ANALYSIS OF CODE CHANGES:
   Based on the DIFF, the only change made by the developer is:
  
  -const port = process.env.PORT || 5000;
  +const port = process.env.PORT || 4000; 
  
  The developer changed the default port number from 5000 to 4000.
  
  In my opinion, this change does not necessarily improve or worsen the code. It simply modifies the default port that the server listens on. As long as the new port number 4000 does not conflict with any other service on the server, this change should work fine. The port number is an implementation detail and does not affect the functionality or logic of the code.
  
  So in summary, this is a neutral change that modifies an implementation detail (the default port number) but does not improve or worsen the actual source code. The functionality and logic remain the same.

   *CODE SUMMARY:* 
  This code is JavaScript using the Express web framework. It is setting up an Express router and enabling Express sessions.
  
  *CODE REVIEW:*
  
  1. Observation: The secret string is hardcoded.  
         - Reasoning: Hardcoding secrets in code is a security risk if the code is exposed. Anyone with the code would have access to the secret.
         - Code Example: secret: "a random text for the session"  
         - Code Recommendation: Use an environment variable for the secret instead of hardcoding it.
  
  2. Observation: resave and saveUninitialized are enabled.  
         - Reasoning: This will save empty session objects and constantly re-save existing session objects on each request. This can impact performance.
         - Code Example: resave: true, saveUninitialized: true,  
         - Code Recommendation: Remove resave and saveUninitialized. Only save the session when it is actually modified.  
  
  3. Observation: No session expiration is set.  
         - Reasoning: Without an expiration, old session data may persist and the session can last indefinitely. This could be a security risk if a session is stolen.  
         - Code Example: No maxAge key is present.  
         - Code Recommendation: Set an expiration for the session data using the maxAge key. For example, maxAge: 86400 would set the session to expire after 1 day.
  
  4. Observation: No cookie settings are present.  
         - Reasoning: Without any cookie settings, the default settings will be used. These may not be ideal for security and user experience.  
         - Code Example: No cookie key is present.  
         - Code Recommendation: Configure cookie settings like httpOnly, secure, maxAge, etc. For example:  
           cookie: {  
             httpOnly: true,  
             secure: true,  
             maxAge: 86400  
           }
  
  ANALYSIS OF CODE CHANGES:
   The developer has made changes to the secret used for session management in Express.
  
  Specifically:
  - The secret has been changed from "a random text for the session" to "a random text for the ppassweasdas isasd"
  
  I would consider this change to make the code worse for the following reasons:
  
  1. The new secret is less random and more predictable. Secrets used for session management should be as random and complex as possible to avoid brute force guessing. The new secret contains actual words and repetitions that make it easier to guess.
  
  2. There is a typo in the new secret ("ppassweasdas"). Typos in configuration values are dangerous as they can lead to unintended behavior.
  
  3. There is no comment explaining why this change was made. Changes to sensitive configuration values should be accompanied by comments explaining the reason for the change. Without this context, it is hard to determine if this change was intentional or made in error.
  
  Overall, I would consider this change to degrade the security and quality of the code. The secret should be made more random and complex, the typo should be fixed, and comments should be added to provide context around configuration changes.
